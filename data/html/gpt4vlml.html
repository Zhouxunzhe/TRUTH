[YES]

The glass pan cover is not on the table: The glass pan cover is placed on a green pad or holder, which is on the table. This could be interpreted as not directly being on the table or as being on the table depending on the specificity of the condition as to whether &quot;on the table&quot; means directly in contact with the surface of the table or simply located above/on the structure of the table.
[YES/NO]

Based on the image and the conditions provided, it is ambiguous whether the glass pan cover, which is placed on a pad/holder, counts as being &quot;on the table&quot; according to the interpretation of that condition. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether ALL conditions are met.
